    This page was designed with responsiveness in mind. The other goal of this page is to create a potential prototype for the new look the css of my web page will look like.

    <p>Github is a great source to host sites, since they offer a reasonable free package for hosting. <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">They also offer good packages for students.</a>
    <p>The developer of this website really enjoys working with computers. He has been interested in them and programming for a long time. He likes programming and is interested in other aspects of technology as well.</p>
    <p>A great programming environment to use is <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>. Interestingly enough, atom is written using html, javascript, css, and node.js. However, it works very well for writing code.</p>
